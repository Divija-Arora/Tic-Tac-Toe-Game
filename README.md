# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
An interactive Tic Tac Toe game built in Python and Jupyter Notebook, offering a fair play experience with input validation and win-condition checks for rows, columns, and diagonals in the 3x3 grid gameplay.
The Tic Tac Toe game project is an interactive implementation of the classic pen-and-paper game created using Python within Jupyter Notebook. This two-player game offers an enjoyable experience where players take turns to place their symbols, X and O, on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game results in a draw.

To ensure a fair play experience, the game features input validation, preventing players from making invalid moves and ensuring that the game progresses smoothly. The players can easily interact with the game using the Jupyter Notebook interface, making it accessible and user-friendly.

The game includes win-condition checks after each move, examining the rows, columns, and diagonals to determine if a player has achieved a winning pattern. Once a win condition is met, the game announces the winner and prompts the players to start a new game or exit.

In case no player achieves a winning pattern and the grid is fully occupied, the game declares a draw, allowing players to challenge each other to a rematch or try their luck with a new opponent.

The logical implementation and comprehensive validation contribute to the robustness and reliability of the Tic Tac Toe game. It serves as an excellent Python project for beginners to practice their programming skills and gain insights into basic game development concepts. Moreover, it provides an enjoyable and nostalgic experience for players of all ages.
